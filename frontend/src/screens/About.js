          Reader's World established in 2020, is a Pakistani chain of nationwide bookstores. We started our journey from a kiosk in the old city Karachi and have built a national network of artisanal bookstores and a personalized online experience delivering books all around Pakistan.

To our diverse readership, we provide a wide array of 90,000 titles of affordable bargain books, gifts, and educational resource materials. We endeavor to provide a hospitable and nurturing environment to encourage the healthy exchange of ideas by hosting numerous book launches, book bazaars, children story reading sessions, panel presentations, and online discussions.

We are committed to engaging with the many diverse readers and organizations of our society on a national scale, to work united towards the goals of a knowledgeable and educated community.

We are passionate about the written word and seek to share our love of reading to help create and sustain a nation of lifelong readers.
